# aida-neural-net-models

A Neural Network model that attempts to solve both a problem of regression and classification - there are multiple classes of circuits whose dimensions we wish to project; the input data corresponds to 4 types of performances from those circuits; the output of the Neural Network will be the class to which those performances correspond to and the dimensions of the circuit. Uses several Python tools as well as the Keras API, with TensorFlow as its backend.
